# BlackJack-GUI

It is an implementation of the popular BlackJack casino game made in c++ using libary QT to make the graphical user interface.

## Description

After starting the game, we choose the amount of chips we want to bet in the game.
We have several game options to choose from as in classic BlackJack

<b>Stand</b>: Take no more cards.

<b>Hit</b>: Take another card.

<b>Double down</b>: Double the wager, take exactly one more card, and then stand. 

<b>Insurance</b>: It's a side bet, which is offered to the players when the dealer’s up card is an ace. Takes an additional half of the chips plac                                It insures the player against the dealer having a ‘blackjack’ and gives them a chance to break even on the hand, if the dealer’s                                cards total 21.

## Rules

BlackJack is paid out as 250% of the bet placed. BlackJack is only when we have 2 cards (Ace and "10") and the croupier does not have BlackJack.

If we are closer to 21 points than the dealer and nobody has gone over 21 points, we get 200% of our bet.

if the dealer is closer to 21 points than you and no one has passed 21 points, we lose the placed bet.

If we exceed 21 points we lose the placed bet.

If the dealer exceeds 21 points, we get 200% of our bet.

If there is a tie we get 100% of the bet placed.
